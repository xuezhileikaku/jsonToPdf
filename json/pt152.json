Entropy increases because there are more ways for a system to be disordered than for it to be ordered. Therefore, if change occurs, it is more likely to be change toward greater disorder. For example, in a moderately orderly room, if one moves an object in the room randomly, there are many more places one can put it that will make the room less orderly than there are places that will make it more orderly.
